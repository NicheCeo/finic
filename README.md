[Finic](https://finic.ai/) provides browser infrastructure for developers building web scrapers, browser automations, and AI agents in Python. It does this by giving you a browser in the cloud you can control remotely using Playwright or Puppeteer (in just a few lines), or Selenium (with some work).

Finic is designed to be **unopionated about the development process**, and simply provide browser and network-level utilities to make sure your automations don't get blocked.

# Quickstart
```bash
git clone https://github.com/finic-ai/finic.git
```

## Running Locally
Run the image locally the same as any other Docker container.

```bash
docker compose
docker up
```

Once the container is running, you can connect to it like this.
```python
from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright

playwright = sync_playwright().start()
browser = playwright.chromium.connect(cdp="ws://localhost:8080/ws")    
page = browser.new_page()
await page.goto("https://github.com/finic-ai/finic")
# ... The rest of your automation code
```

If you want to use a Finic browser with an existing project, simply replace this line:
```python
browser = playwright.chromium.launch(headless=False)
```
with this one:
with this:
```
browser = playwright.chromium.connect(cdp_url="ws://localhost:8080/ws")
```
